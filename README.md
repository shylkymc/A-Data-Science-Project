# A-Data-Science-Project

In this project, I used two data sets which are obtained from Data Science Stack Exchange website. I used Microsoft SQL queries to obtain data sets from this [link](https://data.stackexchange.com/datascience/query/new).
The data set has information about question posts. My goal is to understand the data science subject which students are having trouble with.Thanks to this information I obtained, and determined the content of the data science course to be established in the future.
I used Pandas library to open and clean data sets. I found the most used tags and the most viewed tags. I used Matplotlib to visualize them. 
After that, I found relationships between tags. I used Seaborn to visualize this relationship. I figured out that the deep learning content has more tags. Finally, I dept into deep learning tags.


## Conclusion

I see that there are a lot of questions about deep learning. At the last quarter of 2019, the rate of deep learning questions is approximately 41%.
As a result, a data science education program can contain commonly deep learning contents.
